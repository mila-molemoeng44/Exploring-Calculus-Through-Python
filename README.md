# The Purpose of Exploration
This project was a manifestation of questions concerning the capabilities of Python and Python's ability to symbolically represent interesting topics in Calculus I. 
A topic in Python and math I wanted to explore was differentiability. The elementary implementation of differentiability was the presence or lack of presence of a value for f(x). 
On top of determining differentiability, I wanted to explore different values of f'(x) at provided values of x. 
The other topic I wanted to explore was Chain Rule. Chain Rule in itself is such an intriguing concept that I felt deserved an exploration in Python. Learning it was fun, but implementing it in Python was even more intriguing!
Lastly, I've always been intrigued with the creation of 3d outputs in programs and I found no better way to do that than with Python! It was incredibly fun seeing the ways I could manipulate the 3d output.
